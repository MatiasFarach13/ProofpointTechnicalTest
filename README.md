# ProofpointTechnicalTest
Resolution of the technical evaluation to apply for the ProofPoint internship.


Answer to the questions:

1- Describe the most relevant learnings from programming-related subjects.

My most relevant learnings related to programming were and continue to be at university. I have learned a solid foundation of functional programming and object-oriented programming in Python, but I stand out more in backend development with Java. I have had the opportunity to take and pass a specific subject on application backend, where I have learned Java language, Microservices (APIs, Spring framework, Data access and ORM, Gateway, implementation patterns and SOLID principles), Backend security (user authentication, security patterns), data persistence and integration with frontend. I also have a good performance in SQL.

2- Describe a situation you had to resolve with a teammate from a study or workgroup.

In one of my courses, I faced a significant challenge when the group I was working with on a final integrative project disbanded because my teammates failed the midterm exam. This left me in a complex situation, as I only had one week to develop the backend of the project with no possibility of recovery.

In response, I took the initiative to find others who were in the same situation and quickly formed a new team. Once the new group was assembled, I proposed dividing the tasks in the most equitable and efficient way, ensuring each member had a clear role. To optimize our workflow, we held daily meetings where we reviewed our progress, integrated our parts, and set new objectives for the following day. Thanks to this organization and the team's commitment, we were able to complete the project within the established timeframe and received a grade of 9.

This experience allowed me to develop key skills such as problem-solving under pressure, leadership, and teamwork. I am proud of the outcome, as we were able to overcome an unexpected difficulty and successfully achieve our goal.

3- Describe your personal learning plans or development expectations in technical areas.

I am highly motivated to enter the job market and contribute to challenging software projects where I can apply my knowledge, work collaboratively, and continue learning continuously. My goal is to create value in every project I participate in, improving my technical skills and gaining hands-on experience.

I specialize in backend development and aim to grow professionally in this field, contributing to the success of both the company and the team I work with. I am particularly motivated to work in agile environments, where I can collaborate efficiently, adapt to new challenges, and enhance both my technical expertise and teamwork skills.

In the long term, I aspire to advance in my career and eventually lead software projects, combining technical knowledge with management skills. I am passionate about software development and committed to my professional growth, always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies to continuously add value to the projects I work on.


The Library's Lost Books
I leave attached the compressed where there is a java maven project where I solve the problem of "The Library's Lost Books", with the help of AI, I have created a CSV file of 211 book records with forced errors and a header line (it is inside the project), where each entry has a title, author name and publication date separated by a comma "," . If you want, you can put your own csv file in the program, all you have to do is paste it into the "resources" folder of the project and change the file name in the route of the static variable "FILE_PATH" of the main program.

Word Frequency Analysis


I've also attached the Java Maven project for the "Word Frequency Analysis" exercise, using the same method as the previous exercise. If you'd like, you can modify the project with your own text file, as explained above.
